Ansible RKE2 (RKE Government) Playbook
---------
[![LINT](https://github.com/rancherfederal/rke2-ansible/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rancherfederal/rke2-ansible/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

RKE2, also known as RKE Government, is Rancher's next-generation Kubernetes distribution. This Ansible playbook installs RKE2 for both the control plane and workers.

See the [docs](https://docs.rke2.io/) more information about [RKE Government](https://docs.rke2.io/).


Platforms
---------
The RKE2 Ansible playbook supports all [RKE2 Supported Operating Systems](https://docs.rke2.io/install/requirements/#operating-systems)

Supported Operating Systems:
- SLES 15
- Rocky 8 and 9
- RedHat: 8 and 9
- Ubuntu: 18, 20, and 22


System requirements
-------------------
Deployment environment must have Ansible 2.9.0+

Usage
-----
Create a new directory based on the `sample` directory within the `inventory` directory:

```bash
cp -R inventory/sample inventory/my-cluster
```

Second, edit `inventory/my-cluster/hosts.yaml` to match the system information gathered above. For example:

```yaml
rke2_cluster:
  children:
    rke2_servers:
      hosts:
        server1.example.com:
    rke2_agents:
      hosts:
        agent1.example.com:
        agent2.example.com:
          node_labels:
          - agent2Label=true"
all:
  vars:
    install_rke2_version: v1.27.10+rke2r1
```

If needed, you can also edit `inventory/my-cluster/group_vars/rke2_agents.yml` and `inventory/my-cluster/group_vars/rke2_servers.yml` to match your environment.

Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory/my-cluster/hosts.yml
```  

More detailed information can be found [here](./docs/README.md)


Tarball Install/Air-Gap Install  
-------------------------------  
Air-Gap/Tarball install information can be found [here](./docs/tarball_install.md)


Kubeconfig
----------
The root user will have the `kubeconfig` and `kubectl` made available, to access your cluster login into any server node and `kubectl` will be available for use immideatly. 


Available configurations  
------------------------  
Variables should be set in `inventory/cluster/group_vars/rke2_agents.yml` and `inventory/cluster/group_vars/rke2_servers.yml`. See sample variables in `inventory/sample/group_vars` for reference.


Uninstall RKE2  
---------------  
    Note: Uninstalling RKE2 deletes the cluster data and all of the scripts.
The offical documentation for fully uninstalling the RKE2 cluster can be found in the [RKE2 Documentation](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall/).

If you used this module to created the cluster and RKE2 was installed via yum, then you can attempt to run this command to remove all cluster data and all RKE2 scripts.

Replace `ec2-user` with your ansible user.
```bash
ansible -i 18.217.113.10, all -u ec2-user -a "/usr/bin/rke2-uninstall.sh"
```

If the tarball method was used then you can attempt to use the following command:
```bash
ansible -i 18.217.113.10, all -u ec2-user -a "/usr/local/bin/rke2-uninstall.sh"
```
On rare occasions you may have to run the uninstall commands a second time.

Known Issues
------------------
- For RHEL8+ Operating Systems that have fapolicyd daemon running, rpm installation of RKE2 will fail due to a permission error while starting containerd. Users have to add the following rules file before installing RKE2. This is not an issue if the install.sh script is used to install RKE2. The RPM issue is expected to be fixed in later versions of RKE2.
```bash
cat <<-EOF >>"/etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/80-rke2.rules"
allow perm=any all : dir=/var/lib/rancher/
allow perm=any all : dir=/opt/cni/
allow perm=any all : dir=/run/k3s/
allow perm=any all : dir=/var/lib/kubelet/
EOF

systemctl restart fapolicyd

```
